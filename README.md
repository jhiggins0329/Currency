# Currency
Objectives

After completing this assignment, you will...

Understand how to override mathematical operators.
Understand how objects can return objects of other classes as responses to messages.
Understand how to execute Python code which spans multiple files.
Understand how to create your own exception classes.
Be able to initialize an object from a set of parameters.
Be able to initialize a set of objects from a complex data structure.
Be able to raise exceptions/errors as appropriate.
Be able to parse strings to isolate specific symbols.
Deliverables

A GitHub repository.
A Currency class in its own file.
A CurrencyConverter class in its own file.
A suite of unit tests for both Currency and CurrencyConverter classes.
A high quality README.
A series of commits on that repository. Not just one at the end!
After your work is complete, make sure to git push your changes up to GitHub. Feel free to do this more than once along the way, of course.

Use the homework submission form on the course website to turn in a link to your GitHub repository.

Normal Mode

In this assignment, you will be asked to create your first Python classes. One of those classes will represent an amount of currency (a real-world thing you can point to), and the second will represent a currency converter (arguably a real-world person, but actually a set of procedures).

In order to complete this assignment, your classes (and objects instantiated from them) must satisfy all of the requirements below. You may tackle these in any order, but every time you finish a requirement, commit your code with a message describing the requirement. This means that you will have a lot of commits.

Currency objects

Must be created with an amount and a currency code.
Must equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code.
Must NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code.
Must be able to be added to another Currency object with the same currency code.
Must be able to be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code.
Must raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects with different currency codes.
Must be able to be multiplied by an int or float and return a Currency object.
Currency() must be able to take one argument with a currency symbol embedded in it, like "$1.20" or "â‚¬ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency code. It can also take two arguments, one being the amount and the other being the currency code.
CurrencyConverter objects

Must be initialized with a dictionary of currency codes to conversion rates (see link to rates below).
At first, just make this work with two currency codes and conversation rates, with one rate being 1.0 and the other being the conversation rate. An example would be this: {'USD': 1.0, 'EUR': 0.74}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros.
Must be able to take a Currency object and a requested currency code that is the same currency code as the Currency object's and return a Currency object equal to the one passed in. That is, currency_converter.convert(Currency(1, 'USD'), 'USD') == Currency(1, 'USD').
Must be able to take a Currency object that has one currency code it knows and a requested currency code and return a new Currency object with the right amount in the new currency code.
Must be able to be created with a dictionary of three or more currency codes and conversion rates. An example would be this: {'USD': 1.0, 'EUR': 0.74, 'JPY': 120.0}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros and that a dollar is worth 120 yen, but also that a euro is worth 120/0.74 = 162.2 yen.
Must be able to convert Currency in any currency code it knows about to Currency in any other currency code it knows about.
Must raise an UnknownCurrencyCodeError when you try to convert from or to a currency code it doesn't know about.
